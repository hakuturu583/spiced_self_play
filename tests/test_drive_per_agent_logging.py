"""Behavioral tests for the per-agent EMA logging path in Drive's vec_log.

Covered:
- T1 (gate): vec_log emits nothing while no agent has completed an episode;
  the first emission appears exactly when the scenario truncates.
- T2 (steady-state n): after enough steps for every agent to complete at
  least one episode, dict["n"] equals num_agents.
- T3 (state persistence): two consecutive emissions with no new completions
  between them produce identical metric values, proving prepare_log no
  longer resets the per-agent EMAs.
